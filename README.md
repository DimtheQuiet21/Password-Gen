# Password Generator Starter Code - by Alan Lee

## Description

This password generator will act as testament to my early abilities with javascript. 

This generator should demonstrate my current skills in linking HTML, CSS, and Javascript as well as my commitement to the user experience alongside competency in javascripting. 


This current version of my personal profile features several things.
1). Allows for the user to select multiple password criteria both the start of the process and after the initial conditions are set.
2). Is responsive in alerting the user when invalid criteria have been selected, but allows for easy fixes.
3). Generates an elaborate and complicated password based on the user's suite of criteria 

This password generator should both be fully functional and accessible to all users as well as easy to adapt and update in the future.

Through the process of creating this password geneator, I have displayed that I am rather comfortable in workign withj javascript. I have years of experience in Matlab and a competency in python, so transitioning to javascript was relatively straightforward. I am still learning and growing with functions and calling them in javascript but the dot notation is significantly easier for me to understand. If anything, writing the functions above the code is the oddest thing for someone used to the Matlab space where functions go below.
